# Spicy-based Zeek IGMP packet analyzer :hot_pepper:

This repository contains a [Zeek](https://zeek.org/) packet analyzer for the [IGMP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Group_Management_Protocol), based on [Spicy](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/index.html).
It is packed as a Zeek package, which can be easily installed with [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before trying to install the package, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Zeek](https://zeek.org/)
- [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/) command `zkg`
- [Spicy plugin](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/index.html) for Zeek

Everything should be installed correctly if you install the latest [Zeek](https://zeek.org/) version.

### Setup

A simple call to `make install` from the repository's root directory should install the package and run unit tests.
You can also use the `zkg` command directly:
```shell
zkg install $REPOSITORY_ROOT_DIRECTORY
```

To confirm that installation was successful, you can run the following command:
```shell
zeek -NN | grep IGMP
```

If the command's output shows something similar to:
```
[Packet Analyzer] Spicy::IGMP (ANALYZER_SPICY__IGMP)
```
the package was correctly installed, and you have access to the IGMP packet analyzer.

In the case of any installation problems, please check the [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/) documentation.


## Usage

Once the Zeek package installed, you will be able to use the IGMP packet analyzer in your Zeek scripts.
You will have to explicitly load the package scripts in the beginning of your Zeek scripts with the following instruction:
```
